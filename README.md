
## Project Title

**Visual JavaScript IDE with HTML & CSS Integration**

## Project Overview

A web-based IDE that enables users to visually create JavaScript applications with full HTML and CSS integration. Inspired by platforms like Google Blockly and Kodular, this IDE will allow users to construct programs using code blocks and view real-time code and output.

## Target Audience

- Coding beginners and students
- Educators and trainers
- Hobbyists and rapid prototypers

## Key Features

### 1. Visual Block Editor

- Drag-and-drop code blocks for:
  - JavaScript logic (variables, loops, functions, conditions, events)
  - HTML elements (buttons, text, inputs, images, containers, etc.)
  - CSS styling (colors, sizes, borders, fonts, animations, flex/grid layout)
- Blocks auto-generate equivalent source code

### 2. Real-Time Code Display

- Side panel showing live-updated JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code
- Toggle to view/hide each code type separately
- Optional manual editing of generated code

### 3. Live Preview Pane

- Renders the output of the code in real-time
- Supports interactivity (e.g., button clicks, DOM events)
- Auto-refreshes when blocks are updated

### 4. Project Management

- Save projects locally or in the cloud
- Load previous block layouts (via JSON/XML)
- Export:
  - Full webpage in a single HTML file (with inline CSS/JS)
  - HTML, CSS, and JS in separate files inside a ZIP
  - Block structure in JSON/XML

### 5. User Interface

- Intuitive drag-and-drop workspace
- Resizable code and preview panes
- Responsive layout for desktop and tablet
- Light and dark theme toggle

### 6. Extensibility (Optional Phase)

- Plugin support for new blocks or functionality
- Load external JS libraries (like jQuery, Chart.js, etc.)
- API connector blocks (e.g., fetch, axios)

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Tailwind or custom), JavaScript (React or Vue recommended)
- **Block Editor:** Google Blockly or custom block engine
- **Preview Engine:** Sandbox iframe rendering
- **Code Sync:** AST-based mapping between blocks and code

## Milestones

1. **MVP**

   - Basic block editor (HTML/JS blocks)
   - Code sync view
   - Live preview

2. **v1.0 Launch**

   - CSS support
   - Export/import projects
   - Theming and responsive design

3. **v2.0+ (Stretch Goals)**

   - Plugin system
   - Library integration
   - Cloud save/account system

## Success Metrics

- Working MVP with drag-and-drop programming and accurate live preview
- Code output identical to block structure
- Usability feedback from early testers
